# ETG---TEXT-ENCODING-AND-DECODING-USING-WORD-CLOUD

### PYTHON CODE FOR ENCODING AND DECODING THE TEXT USING WORD CLOUD

- Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in the form of numbers
- At first in this project, the csv file (t_asv.csv) is converted into text file (t_asv.txt)
- Then, text pre-processing is carried-out and Word Cloud is created
- After the creation of Word Cloud, the words in the text file (t_asv.txt) are encoded and then decoded
- Also, the frequency of each word in the text file (t_asv.txt) is identified
